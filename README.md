## Update (2021-06-10)
In light of a more up-to-date map available with better support from the PSO2:NGS community, please visit the map at https://ngs-map.kosnag.ru/, or visit its GitHub repo at https://github.com/kosnag/NGS_InterMap/ for more details on contributing. That being said, this project will still be updated with content and ideas, just not as frequently or as up-to-date as the main map.

# ngs-world-map
The World Map of Halpha at your disposal

Documentation to come, but here's the current roadmap:

* Come up with a better name for this project. No one wants to type "ngs-world-map...".
* ~~Add the ability to toggle landmark and gathering nodes~~
* ~~Add the ability to view the regions and what kind of zone it is~~
* ~~Partially block out the rest of the map due to the game only launching with the Aelio region~~
* Add a side control panel to make it a legitimate map
* Replace the traced SVG landmark icons with an official version
* ~~Implement tooltips~~
* ~~Add the ability to add localized text~~
